<h1>About Civic Ledger Atlas: Standards for US Public Records Research</h1>
</div>
</header>
<section id="mission" class="container content-section">
<h2>Mission and Audience</h2>
<p>Civic Ledger Atlas exists to help readers in the United States navigate public records with clarity, rigor, and confidence. Our mission is to demystify the processes of finding, requesting, and verifying government records so that anyone—regardless of professional background—can access the information they need to make informed decisions, hold institutions accountable, and participate meaningfully in civic life.</p>
<p>We serve a diverse audience united by a common need for reliable public records guidance. Journalists use public records to investigate stories, verify claims, and provide accountability coverage. Community advocates access records to understand government decisions affecting their neighborhoods, from zoning changes to budget allocations. Students and academic researchers rely on public records for primary source material in coursework and scholarly projects. Homeowners research property histories, easements, and permit records when buying, selling, or improving real estate. Small business owners examine licensing requirements, competitor filings, and regulatory compliance records.</p>
<p>Our editorial approach is expert, direct, and practical. We write for readers who want actionable guidance rather than abstract theory. We explain concepts clearly without oversimplifying, acknowledge complexity where it exists, and provide concrete steps readers can follow. We do not provide legal advice—public records research often intersects with legal questions that require consultation with qualified attorneys. Instead, we equip readers with the knowledge and methods to conduct their own research effectively and to recognize when professional assistance may be warranted.</p>
<p>The tone throughout Civic Ledger Atlas reflects respect for our readers' intelligence and time. We assume you are capable of handling detailed information and making your own judgments. We avoid unnecessary jargon while using precise terminology where accuracy requires it. Our goal is to be the resource we wished existed when we first encountered the fragmented landscape of US public records access.</p>

<h2>Sourcing and Verification Standards</h2>
<p>Rigorous sourcing is the foundation of credible public records research. Civic Ledger Atlas distinguishes between primary and secondary sources and prioritizes each appropriately. Primary sources are original records created or maintained by government agencies—the deed recorded at the county clerk's office, the court filing in the official docket, the budget document published by the finance department. Secondary sources interpret, analyze, or report on primary sources—news articles, academic papers, reports from nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p>Our hierarchy of source reliability places official government sources at the top. Records obtained directly from custodian agencies through official channels carry the highest evidentiary weight. We prioritize .gov domains for federal, state, and local government information, .edu domains for academic and research institution materials, and established .org domains for recognized nongovernmental organizations with demonstrated expertise and editorial standards. Major news organizations with professional editorial processes provide valuable secondary source material for context and corroboration.</p>
<p>When citing sources, we emphasize documentation that enables verification. This includes record identifiers (docket numbers, parcel IDs, filing numbers), dates (filing dates, effective dates, retrieval dates), custodian agencies (the specific office responsible for the record), and retrieval paths (how the record was obtained—online portal, in-person request, FOIA response). This documentation allows readers to locate the same records independently and assess the currency and authenticity of information.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Method over rumor. Every assertion should trace to a source, every source should be identifiable, and every reader should be able to verify independently."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For authoritative guidance on federal records and archival research methods, the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/" rel="noopener">National Archives</a> provides extensive resources including research guides, finding aids, and access procedures. The <a href="https://www.census.gov/" rel="noopener">U.S. Census Bureau</a> offers demographic and economic data that contextualizes many public records research projects. University library research guides, typically hosted on .edu domains, provide discipline-specific guidance on primary source research methodology. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)" rel="noopener">Wikipedia article on the Freedom of Information Act</a> offers accessible background on the history and structure of federal transparency law.</p>

<h3>If You Only Do Three Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>Always trace claims back to the primary source record</li>
<li>Document identifiers, dates, and custodians for every record you cite</li>
<li>Cross-check with at least one reputable secondary source before drawing conclusions</li>
</ul>

<h2>How This Site Is Built: Static, Accessible, Fast</h2>
<p>Civic Ledger Atlas is built as a static website with no JavaScript, no external dependencies, and no tracking scripts. This architectural choice reflects our commitment to accessibility, performance, privacy, and long-term maintainability. Static sites load quickly on any connection speed, work reliably across all browsers and devices, and present no barriers to users with assistive technologies or restrictive network environments.</p>
<p>The site uses semantic HTML5 throughout, with proper document structure including header, nav, main, article, section, aside, and footer elements. This semantic markup enables screen readers and other assistive technologies to navigate content effectively. Heading hierarchy follows logical order—one h1 per page, followed by h2 and h3 elements that reflect content organization. All interactive elements are keyboard accessible, and focus states are clearly visible.</p>
<p>Our CSS is custom-written without external frameworks or libraries. We use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming, CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts, and media queries for breakpoints at 768px and 1024px. The stylesheet includes a prefers-reduced-motion media query that disables transitions and animations for users who have indicated this preference in their operating system settings. All color combinations meet WCAG contrast requirements for readability.</p>
<p>Navigation uses clean URLs: the homepage is accessible at the root path, the FAQ at /faq, and this page at /about-us. These human-readable URLs are easy to share, bookmark, and remember. Internal linking connects all pages bidirectionally, supporting both user navigation and search engine discovery.</p>
<p>We update this site periodically to review external links, refresh guidance based on changes in law or agency procedures, and incorporate reader feedback. Because the site is static, updates are deliberate and documented rather than continuous. If you encounter broken links or outdated information, the guidance on the <a href="/faq">FAQ page</a> and the methodology on the <a href="/">home page</a> provide context for evaluating currency. For the most current official information, always verify with the relevant government agency directly.</p>
<p>This approach—static files, semantic markup, accessible design, no tracking—reflects our belief that informational websites should prioritize reader needs over technical complexity. You should be able to access this content on any device, any connection, any browser, without surrendering privacy or waiting for scripts to load. The content is the product; everything else is in service of delivering it clearly.</p>
